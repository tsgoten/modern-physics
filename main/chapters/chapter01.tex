\section{Newton's Laws}
We can express Newton's laws with a couple of equations. \\
The first main equation
\[ \vec{F}_{net} = m \vec{a} = \dfrac{d \vec{p}}{dt} \]
where $ \vec{a} $ is acceleration, $ m $ is mass, and $ \vec{p} $ is momentum, given by $ \vec{p} = m \vec{v} $. 
\subsection*{Hooke's Laws}
\[ F = -kx \]
We can solve this differential equation to get 
\[ -kx = m \dfrac{d^2 x}{dt^2} \]
Total momentum is conserved, described by 
\[ \vec{P}_{tot} = \mbox{ a constant vector} \]
\section{Work and Energy}
Total energy is conserved \\ 
Work, a scalar, is shown by
\[ W = \int_{\vec{r}_i}^{\vec{r}_f} \vec{F} \cdot d \vec{r} \]
